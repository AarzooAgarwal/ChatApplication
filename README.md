# ChatApplication
This app is just like Whatsapp or other messaging applications where users can send messages to each other. Fake users are made on firebase, and this complete project is implemented on AndroidStudio. Language used-Java. This project was made by me for zomentum shortlisting round. 
Few features that have been added to this app is- we have to enter our number and an otp will be sent to verify our account. This is done by making a fake user on firebase-> Realtime Databse where we give a number with it's country code and we also give a verification code.
We can make as many fake users as we want. For futher understanding, I am adding the link-https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/ make sure your recent project is added to it.
Now after that we fetch the contact list from the Realtime Databse and display it.
We are good to go to send messages between two users and display it.
